          "answer": "How to understand loss val_acc in Keras model fitting , Answering your questions:As described on official keras FAQthe training loss is the average of the losses over each batch of training data. Because your model is changing over time the loss over the first batches of an epoch is generally higher than over the last batches. On the other hand the testing loss for an epoch is computed using the model as it is at the end of the epoch resulting in a lower loss.Training should be stopped when val_acc stops increasing otherwise your model will probably overffit. You can use earlystopping callback to stop training.Your model seems to achieve very good results. Keep up the good work. , What are loss and val_loss?In deep learning the loss is the value that a neural network is trying to minimize: it's the distance between the ground truth and the predictions. In order to minimize this distance the neural network learns by adjusting weights and biases in a manner that reduces the loss.For instance in regression tasks you have a continuous target e.g. height. What you want to minimize is the difference between your predictions and the actual height. You can use mean_absolute_error as loss so the neural network knows this is what it needs to http://minimize.In classification it's a little more complicated but very similar. Predicted classes are based on probability. The loss is therefore also based on probability. In classification the neural network minimizes the likelihood to assign a low probability to the actual class. The loss is typically categorical_crossentropy.loss and val_loss differ because the former is applied to the train set and the latter the test set. As such the latter is a good indication of how the model performs on unseen data. You can get a validation set by using validation_data=[x_test y_test] or validation_split=0.2.It's best to rely on the val_loss to prevent overfitting. Overfitting is when the model fits the training data too closely and the loss keeps decreasing while the val_loss is stale or http://increases.In Keras you can use EarlyStopping to stop training when the val_loss stops decreasing. Read here.Read more about deep learning losses here: Loss and Loss Functions for Training Deep Learning Neural Networks.What are acc and val_acc?Accuracy is a metric only for classification. It makes no sense on a task with a continuous target. It gives the percentage of instances that are correctly classified.Once again acc is on the training data and val_acc is on the validation data. It's best to rely on val_acc for a fair representation of model performance because a good neural network will end up fitting the training data at 100% but would perform poorly on unseen data.",

          "answer": "Gain instant data-access from both traditional enterprise applications and new webscale workloads. Consolidated workloads and aggregated data: With Purity, you can easily consolidate workloads and aggregate data with block access over Fibre Channel, iSCSI, NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF), plus native file access for SMB and NFS. Faster, more consistent performance: Pure's 100% NVMe storage has built-in QoS that ensures every workload gets the IOPs and throughput it requires. Pure DirectFlash Fabric gives you maximum throughput for high-performance business applications with microsecond latency that's far more predictable than with conventional SSDs. Acceleration of performance-sensitive applications: For the fastest possible response from databases, Pure DirectMemory™ with Intel Optane Storage-class Memory (SCM) delivers up to an additional 50% reduction in latency. A cache boost for all your business-critical apps-SAP HANA, Oracle, SQL Server, and cloud-native databases-can be as simple as plugging in DirectMemory modules. No configuration or tuning is required. File workloads with block applications: If you run NAS-based apps in addition to SAN-based enterprise databases, Purity's consolidated SAN and NAS capabilities let you avoid the trouble and expense of running two incompatible environments. Edge to core to cloud data-access: Authorized users can access their data wherever they are in the world-and wherever their data resides: at core data centers on-premises, remote within branch offices, or in the cloud with native data mobility....",
