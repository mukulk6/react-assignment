            "answerText": "Ideally, all programs should be correct, that is, there is no fault in a program. Due to the impractical nature of proving even small programs to be correct, customers and software developers rely on the efficacy of testing. In this section, we introduce two main limitations of testing: • Testing means executing a program with a generally small, proper subset of the input domain of the program. A small, proper subset of the input domain is chosen because cost may not allow a much larger subset to be chosen, let alone the full input set. Testing with the full input set is known as exhaustive testing. Thus, the inherent need to test a program with a small subset of the input domain poses a fundamental limit on the efficacy of testing. The limit is in the form of our inability to extrapolate the correctness of results for a proper subset of the input domain to program correctness. In other words, even if a program Evergreen//One (formerly Pure as-a-Service)ses a test set T , we cannot conclude that the program is correct. • Once we have selected a subset of the input domain, we are faced with the problem of verifying the correctness of the program outputs for individual test input. That is, a program output is examined to determine if the program performed correctly on the test input. The mechanism which verifies the correctness of a program output is known as an oracle. The concept of an oracle is discussed in detail in Chapter 9. Determining the correctness of a program output is not a trivial task. If either of the following two conditions hold, a program is considered nontestable [20]: There does not exist an oracle. It is too difficult to determine the correct output. If there is no mechanism to verify the correctness of a program output or it takes an extraordinary amount of time to verify an output, there is not much to be gained by running the test.",

            "answerText": "It is necessary to plan for and design the test environment, also called a test bed or a test laboratory, to make the execution of system-level test cases effective. It is a challenge to design test environments which contain only a small proportion of the equipment and facilities used in actual operation because of budget limitations. The central idea in using a small proportion of equipment and facilities is to do more with less. The objective here is to achieve effective testing whereby most of the defects in the system are revealed by utilizing a limited quantity of resources. One has to be innovative in designing a test bed such that the test objectives are fulfilled by executing the test cases on the test bed. One must consider alternatives, or, at least, a scaled-down version of the deployment environment from the standpoint of cost-effectiveness. Efforts must be made to create a deployment environment by using simulators, emulators, and third-party traffic generation tools. Such tools are found to be useful in conducting scalability, performance, load, and stress testing. An emulator may not be an ideal substitute for real equipment, but as long as it satisfies the purpose, it is worth investing in. We explained in Chapter 8 that there are different categories of test cases designed at the system level. Therefore, multiple test environments are constructed in practice for the following reasons: • To run scalability tests, we need more resources than needed to run func- tional tests. • Multiple test beds are required to reduce the length of system testing time. Preparing for a test environment is a great challenge in test planning. This is especially true in testing distributed systems and computer networks where a vari- ety of equipment are connected through communication protocols. For example, such equipment includes user computers, servers, routers, base stations in a wireless network, authentication servers, and billing servers. It may take several months to set up an effective test bed for large, complex systems. It requires careful planning, procurement of test equipment, and installation of the equipment in a test facility different from the software development facilities so that system testing is per- formed effectively. Developers have their own test environments to perform unit tests and integration tests. However, a separate, dedicated system test laboratory, different from the ones used in unit and integration testing, is essential for the following reasons: • Test engineers need to have the ability to reconfigure a test environment. • Test activities need not interfere with development activities or live oper- ations. • Increased productivity is achieved by having a dedicated test laboratory. A central issue concerning setting up of a system test laboratory is the justification to procure the equipment. Note that there is a need to justify each item to be pro- cured. A good justification for procuring the equipment can be made by answering the following questions: • Why do we need this equipment? • What will be the impact of not having this equipment? • Is there an alternative to procuring this equipment? The technical leader of the system test engineering group should gather some facts and perform some preparation activities in order to get answers to these questions. The following items are part of a good fact gathering process: • Reviews the system requirements and the functional specification • Participates in the review processes to better understand the system and raise potential concerns related to the migration of the system from the development environment to the deployment environment • Documents his or her findings The following preparation activities are conducted to support the development of a system test bed: • Obtain information about the customer deployment architecture, includ- ing hardware, software, and their manufacturers. For example, the real deployment network diagram along with the software configuration is use- ful in designing a scaled-down version of the system in the laboratory. The manufacturer names will be handy in procuring the exact equipment for interoperability and compatibility testing. • Obtain a list of third-party products to be integrated with the SUT. Iden- tification of the external products is important because of the need for performing interoperability testing. • List third-party test tools to be used to monitor, simulate, and/or generate real traffic. This traffic will be used as input to the SUT. • Identify the third-party software tools to be used under licenses. • Identify the hardware equipment necessary to support special features specified in the requirement/test objectives, such as high availability and backup/recovery exercises within the test environment. • List the number of hardware copies to carry out system testing if the project involves new hardware. • Analyze the functional, performance, stress, load, and scalability test objec- tives to identify elements of the test environment that will be required to support those tests. • Identify the security requirements for the test environment. Ensure that the security test cases can be executed using the test environment and an intruder cannot disrupt the stress and stability tests that may be running overnight or over the weekends. • List the small, but necessary networking gears that may be required to set up the test laboratory, such as switches, terminal servers, hubs, attenuators, splitters, personal computers, servers, and different kinds and sizes of cables to interconnect these gears. • List any other accessories required to facilitate system testing, such as racks, vehicles, and special shielding to prevent radiation. After the above fact gathering and researching activities, the team leader develops a schematic diagram of one or more test beds in terms of the following two items: • High-level graphic layout of test architectures • Table of types of equipment, their quantities, and their descriptions to support the test architecture The equipment list should be reviewed to determine the equipment available in-house and those that need to be procured. The list of equipment to be procured constitutes a test equipment purchase list. The list needs to include quantities required, unit price information, including maintenance cost, and justification, as outlined in the template shown in Table 12.2. The team leader must specify, for each item in the justification column, the justification for the item and the impact it will have on system testing in terms of quality and a time-to-market schedule. The team leader may obtain a quote from the suppliers to get an accurate unit price. The test team leader needs to keep track of the equipment received and their installation after the budget is TABLE 12.2 Equipment Needed to be Procured Equipment to Procure Quantity Unit Price Maintenance Cost Justification approved and the orders are placed. The leader needs to ensure that these activities are on track to meet the overall software project schedule.",

            "answerText": "A test automation tool is a software application that assists in the automation of test cases that would otherwise be run manually. Some tools are commercially available in the market, but for testing complex, imbedded, real-time systems, very few commercial test tools are available in the market. Therefore, most organizations build their own test automation frameworks using programming languages such as C and Tcl. It is essential to combine both hardware and software for real-time testing tools. This is due to the fact that special kinds of interface cards are required to be connected to the SUT. The computing power of personal computers with network interface cards may not be good enough to send traffic to the SUT. Test professionals generally build their own test tools in high-technology fields, such as telecommunication equipment and application based on IP. Com- mercial third-party test tools are usually not available during the system testing phase. For example, there were no commercially available test tools during the testing of the 1xEv-DO system described in Chapter 8. The second author of this book developed in-house software tools to simulate access terminals using their own products. However, we advocate that testers should build their own test automa- tion tools only if they have no alternative. Building and maintaining one's own test automation tool from scratch are time-consuming tasks and an expensive under- taking. The test tool evaluation criteria are formulated for the selection of the right kind of software tool. There may be no tool that fulfills all the criteria. Therefore, we should be a bit flexible during the evaluation of off-the-self automation tools available in the market. The broad criteria for evaluating test automation tools have been classified into the following eight categories as shown in Figure 12.3. 1. Test Development Criteria: An automation test tool should provide a high-level, preferably nonproprietary, easy-to-use test scripting language such as Tcl. It should have the ability to interface and drive modules that can be easily written in, for example, C, Tcl, Perl, or Visual Basic. The tool must provide facility to directly access, read, modify, and control the internals of the automated test scripts. The input test data should be stored separately from the test script but easily cross-referenced to the corresponding test scripts, if necessary. The tool should have built-in templates of test scripts, test cases, tutorials, and demo application examples to show how to develop automated test cases. Finally, no changes should be made to the SUT in order to use the tool. The vendor's Figure 12.3 Broad criteria of test automation tool evaluation. recommended environment should match the real test laboratory execution environment. 2. Test Maintenance Criteria: The tool should possess a rich set of features, such as version control capability on test cases, test data, and migration of test cases across different platforms. The tool must provide powerful, easy-to-use facilities to browse, navigate, modify, and reuse the test suites. The tool should have the ability to select a subset of test cases to form a group for a particular test run based on one or more distinguishing characteristics. A tool needs to have features to allow modification and replication of test cases, easy addition of new test cases, and import from another. The tool should have the capability to add multiple tags to a test case and modify those tags so that the test case can be easily selected in a subgroup of test cases sharing a common characteristic. 3. Test Execution Criteria: An automation tool should allow test cases to be executed individually, as a group, or in a predefined sequence. The user should have the ability to check the interim results during the execution of a group of tests and exercise other options for the remainder of the tests based on the interim results. The user should have the option to pause and resume the execution of a test suite. The tool should have the facility to execute the test suite over the Internet. The tool should allow simultaneous execution of several test suites that can be distributed across multiple machines for parallel execution. This substantially reduces the time needed for testing if multiple test machines are available. The test tool should have a capability for monitoring, measuring, and diagnosing performance characteristics of the SUT. Finally, the tool should have the capability to be integrated with other software tools which are either in use or expected to be used. 4. Test Results Criteria: The test tool must provide a flexible, comprehensive logging process during execution of the test suite, which may include detailed records of each test case, test results, time and date, and pertinent diagnostic data. A tool should have the capability to cross-reference the test results back to the right versions of test cases. The test result log can be archived in an industry standard data format and the tool should have an effective way to access and browse the archived test results. The tool should provide query capability to extract test results, analyze the test status and trend, and produce graphical reports of the test results. Finally, the tool should have the capability to collect and analyze response time and throughput as an aid to performance testing. 5. Test Management Criteria: A tool should have the ability to provide a test structure, or hierarchy, that allows test cases to be stored and retrieved in a manner that the test organization wants to organize. The tool should have the capability to allocate tests or groups of tests to specific test engineers and compare the work status with the plan through graphic display. A tool needs to have authorization features. For example, a test script developer may be authorized to create and update the test scripts, while the test executer can only access them in the run mode. The tool should have the capability to send out emails with the test results after completion of test suite execution. 6. GUI Testing Capability Criteria: An automated GUI test tool should include a record/playback feature which allows the test engineers to create, modify, and run automated tests across many environments. These tools should have a capability to recognize and deal with all types of GUI objects, such as list boxes, radio buttons, icons, joysticks, hot keys, and bit-map images with changes in color shades and presentation fonts. The recording activity of the tool capturing the keystrokes entered by the test engineer can be represented as scripts in a high-level programming language and saved for future replay. The tools must allow test engineers to modify test scripts to create reusable test procedures to be played back on a new software image for comparison. The performance of a GUI test tool needs to be evaluated. One may consider the question: How fast can the tool record and playback a complex test scenario or a group of test scenarios? 7. Vendor Qualification Criteria: Many questions need to be asked about the vendor's financial stability, age of the vendor company, and its capability to support the tool. The vendor must be willing to fix problems that arise with the tool. A future roadmap must exist for the product. Finally, the maturity and market share of the product must be evaluated. 8. Pricing Criteria: Pricing is an important aspect of the product evaluation criteria. One can ask a number of questions: Is the price competitive? Is it within the estimated price range for an initial tool purchase? For a large number of licenses, a pricing discount can be negotiated with the vendor. Finally, the license must explicitly cap the maintenance cost of the test tool from year to year. Tool vendors may guarantee the functionality of the test tool; however, expe- rience shows that often test automation tools do not work as expected within the particular test environment. Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate the test tool by using it before making the decision to purchase it. The test team leader needs to contact the tool vendor to request a demonstration. After a demonstration of the tool, if the test team believes that the tool holds potential, then the test team leader may ask for a temporary license of the tool for evaluation. At this point enough resources are allocated to evaluate the test tool. The evaluator should have a clear understanding of the tool requirements and should make a test evaluation plan based on the criteria outlined previously. The goal here is to ensure that the test tool performs as advertised by the vendor and that the tool is the best product for the requirement. Following the hands-on evaluation process, an evaluation report is prepared. The report documents the hands-on experience with the tool. This report should contain background information, a tool summary, technical findings, and a conclusion. This document is designed to address the management concerns because eventually it has to be approved by executive management.",

At that point you can echange the JWT for an access token which would allow the guest user to join as an invitee as well , OK so my problem is that I need to create a meeting from backend server where I won't be having any GUI. , I guess so if you have a webex user with the necessary licenses then you can just use the https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/meetings/createameeting) API and create it programmatically.",
